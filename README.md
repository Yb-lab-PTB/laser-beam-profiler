This is a LabVIEW software to analyse laser beams with various usb cameras. It was developed by Matthias Nee during his internship in Summer 2016. The internship was part of the [MetroSommer] (https://www.ptb.de/cms/presseaktuelles/messenevents/metrosommer-2016.html)  program of PTB. 

The software uses LabVIEW with the vision development module and the vision acquisition software. It has been tested with a [Lumenera Lu105] (https://www.lumenera.com/products/industrial-scientific/lu105.html ) camera, however, the board level version [Lu100] ( https://www.lumenera.com/products/industrial-scientific/lu100.html ) might be advantageous due to its smaller size. 

So far, the user manual is only available in German, translations are welcome.
