This is a LabVIEW software to analyse laser beams with various usb cameras. It was developed by Matthias Nee during his internship in Summer 2016. The internship was part of the MetroSommer program of PTB (https://www.ptb.de/cms/presseaktuelles/messenevents/metrosommer-2016.html). 

The software uses the LabVIEW and the image acquisition tools. It has been tested with a [ https://www.lumenera.com/products/industrial-scientific/lu105.html Lumenera Lu105] camera, however, the board level version [ https://www.lumenera.com/products/industrial-scientific/lu100.html Lu100] might be advantageous due to its smaller size. 

So far, the user manual is only available in German, translations are welcome.
